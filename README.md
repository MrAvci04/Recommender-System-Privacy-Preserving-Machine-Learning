# Privacy Preserving Machine Learning

### Course: Privacy Preserving Machine Learning by Dr. Adi Akavia at The University of Haifa.

This is a Federated Matrix Factorization implementation using homomorphic encryption used for recommendation systems. The project demonstrates a collaborative filtering recommender system where users' data is kept private by performing the matrix factorization using homomorphic encryption techniques.

## Features

- Federated learning with multiple users and a server.
- Matrix factorization using collaborative filtering.
- Homomorphic encryption for secure computation.

## Usage

It's recommended to use Google Colab for running the code. Import the notebook and run the cells.
